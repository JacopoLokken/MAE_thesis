Unzip the file, and open every R script. 

At the beginning of each R script, set the working directory (where the unzipped folder is located). 

The R scripts should be run in the following order:
(1) 1_TrueData.R
(2) 2_Simulation.R
(3) 3_ResultsAnalysis.R
(4) results_visualisation 

In 1_TrueData.R, four directories are created, where Rds files from each of the R scripts are stored.
